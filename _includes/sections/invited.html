            <h2><strong> Grasping and benchmarking on the iCub humanoid robot </strong> </h2>
            Grasping of unknown objects or objects whose pose is uncertain
is still an open problem in robotics. The missing or noisy
information on object models and poses strongly affects
manipulation performance. On the other hand research on grasping is made difficult by the fact that research there are no methodologies for comparing results obtained using different robotic platforms.
In the past few years we have developed a framework for grasping unknown objects of various shapes using superquadric models. We initially proposed to model objects using single superquadric function, and more recently, extended this approach to use multi-superquadrics to model objects with finer details. In the first part of this talk I will revise our work, showing experiments with the iCub humanoid robot on the YCB dataset. In the second part of the talk I will describe a benchmarking protocol and software called GRASPA, which is specifically devised to test effectiveness of grasp planners on real robots, proposing various metrics to take into account of features and limits of the specific platform.</td>

            <h2><strong> Everything is Better With Understanding, Even Learning Manipulation </strong> </h2>
            The most appropriate methodology for solving a problem follows from the problem itself.  This, of course, also holds for manipulation.  Consequently, the discussion about the most appropriate methodology for manipulation, whether it be learning-free or learning-based (supervised, imitation, or deep) – should be informed by an understanding of manipulation. In this talk, I will discuss what I believe to be our current and relevant understanding of manipulation, and how we can make manipulation versatile, dexterous, and robust.  I will also attempt to infer from this which of the possible methodologies might be most appropriate for particular aspect of manipulation.  I hope to convince you that making progress in manipulation is not a question of mutual exclusivity of methodologies but one of clever combination.</td>

            <h2><strong> Five different approaches to solving pick and place </strong> </h2>
            I was recently surprised to discover that members of my
  research group were working on five different approaches to exactly the
  same problem: prehensile pick and place. I think this reflects the fact
  that robotics is changing quickly in response to new machine learning
  methods. There are a lot of new algorithms out there and it's not yet
  clear which ones will turn out to be most helpful to robotics. In this
  talk, I will (briefly) describe the five different approaches to the
  prehensile pick and place problem currently in progress in our lab.
  Interestingly, most of these approaches seek to use elements from more
  traditional planning to speed up policy learning. This could be the key
  to successful application of policy learning to robotics. The question
  is how best to accomplish this.</td>

             In the near future robots will operate more and more next to humans. Robots will be expected to know about all the objects in the domain where they are working, homes as well as industry. This will require methods to rapidly learn new objects, recognise and manipulate them. The talk will review recent advances such as learning objects from CAD models, learning object relations and parts, the use of semantic knowledge related to objects, and the detection of learned object classes from mobile robots.</td>
